This is a Project on Solar Energy Utilization for Daily House Hold use
This is a Computer Graphics Project to show how solar energy can be used in the future. 
Solar energy is a renewable and clean source of energy that can be used to power homes, businesses and even entire cities!
By using solar panels to collect sunlight and convert it into electricity, we can greatly reduce our reliance on fossil fuels and help reduce greenhouse gas emissions that cause global warming. 
This project shows how solar technology has advanced over the years and how it could be used to improve our lives in the future. 
The animation is made up of multiple layers. 
Each layer uses a different filter to give it a unique look and helps to add to the overall message of the project.
